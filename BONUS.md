- While the specification says that a slide element can only be resized by dragging the corners, we found that with the ability of the Rnd library, an element can be resized at any angle (top, right, bottom, and left as well). While these options can be disabled (so that only the corners can be resized), we deem that it is better for users to have this option, like in normal "presentation" software.
